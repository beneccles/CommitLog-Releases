**CommitLog — Desktop Application**
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

---

## Overview

CommitLog is a **privacy-first desktop application**. Your work logs, resume data, and personal content are stored locally on your device and **never leave your computer** unless you explicitly enable optional cloud features.

We do not operate servers that collect, store, or process your data. CommitLog has no user accounts, no telemetry, and no analytics.

---

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- No analytics or telemetry
- No user accounts, email addresses, or passwords
- No tracking cookies or identifiers
- No crash reports (unless you manually choose to share them)
- No usage statistics or behavioral data
- No advertising data

---

## Local Data Storage

All user data is stored locally on your device in a SQLite database.

| Data | Storage Location | Retention |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Work logs | Local SQLite database | Until you delete them |
| Resume content | Local SQLite database | Until you delete them |
| AI-generated content | Local SQLite database | Until you delete them |
| Application settings | Local SQLite database | Until you uninstall |
| AI provider preferences | Local SQLite database | Until you change them |
| EULA/Privacy acceptance record | Local SQLite database | Persistent |

**Database location:**
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/com.commitlog.app/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/com.commitlog.app/`

You have full access to your data at all times. You can delete the database file to remove all stored data.

---

## Local AI Processing

CommitLog allows local AI models that runs entirely on your device.

- The model processes your work logs **locally** — no data is transmitted
- No internet connection is required for local AI features
- The model does not learn from or retain your data between sessions
- Model files are stored locally on your device

---

## Optional Cloud AI Processing (Claude API)

You may **optionally** enable cloud AI processing through Anthropic's Claude API. This feature is **disabled by default** and requires you to actively configure it by providing your own API key.

### What Is Sent to Anthropic

When Cloud AI is enabled and you trigger an analysis:

| Sent | Not Sent |
|------|----------|
| Work log text being analyzed | Your API key (sent separately via secure auth header) |
| Commit messages being analyzed | File paths or local directory structure |
| Analysis prompts generated by the Software | Application settings or preferences |
| | Database contents beyond the specific text being analyzed |
| | Your identity, device information, or IP address (from CommitLog's perspective) |

### When Data Is Sent

Data is transmitted to Anthropic's servers **only** when:
1. You have actively enabled Claude as your AI provider in Settings
2. You trigger an analysis action (e.g., generating resume bullets)

No data is sent in the background or on a schedule.

### API Key Storage

Your Anthropic API key is stored in your operating system's native credential manager:
- **macOS:** Keychain
- **Windows:** Credential Manager

Your API key is **never** stored in the application database, written to log files, or transmitted to anyone other than Anthropic. Keys are validated via a test API call before being stored; the validation timestamp is recorded locally.

### Opting Out

You can disable Cloud AI at any time by switching back to the local AI provider in Settings. When you remove your API key, it is deleted from the OS credential manager immediately.

### Anthropic's Data Handling

Once your data reaches Anthropic's servers, it is processed according to [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy). CommitLog has no control over how Anthropic processes, stores, or retains your data. Please review Anthropic's privacy policy before enabling Cloud AI.

## Network Activity

CommitLog makes network calls only in the following situations:

### App Store Builds (Mac App Store / Microsoft Store)

If you obtained CommitLog from an app store, the application itself makes **no update-related network calls**. Updates are handled entirely by the store and your operating system.

| Network Call | When | What's Sent | Destination |
|-------------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Claude API analysis** | When Cloud AI is enabled and you trigger analysis | Work log text, analysis prompts | Anthropic API (api.anthropic.com) |
| **Claude API key validation** | When you save a new API key | Minimal test request | Anthropic API (api.anthropic.com) |

**When Cloud AI is disabled, store builds make zero network calls.**

### Direct Download Builds

If you obtained CommitLog as a direct download (outside of an app store), the application includes a built-in updater:

| Network Call | When | What's Sent | Destination |
|-------------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Update check** | On app launch (automatic) | App version, platform (macOS/Windows) | CommitLog update server |
| **Update download** | When you accept an available update | Download request | CommitLog update server |
| **Claude API analysis** | When Cloud AI is enabled and you trigger analysis | Work log text, analysis prompts | Anthropic API (api.anthropic.com) |
| **Claude API key validation** | When you save a new API key | Minimal test request | Anthropic API (api.anthropic.com) |

**When Cloud AI is disabled and no update is pending, direct download builds make zero network calls.**

No user content is transmitted during update checks — only the app version and your platform (macOS or Windows) to determine if an update is available.

## Debug Logs

### What Are Debug Logs?

CommitLog writes technical diagnostic logs to your device to help troubleshoot issues.

### What's In the Logs

- Error messages and stack traces
- Performance metrics (processing times)
- System information (OS version, GPU model)
- App version and configuration state

### What's NOT In the Logs

- Your work logs or resume content
- API keys or credentials
- Personal information
- File contents

### Where Logs Are Stored

- **Location:** Application data directory under `logs/`
- **Storage:** Local only — **never uploaded automatically**
- **Retention:** Last 7 days; older logs are automatically deleted
- **Format:** Structured JSON for easier parsing

### Sharing Logs (Manual Only)

If you experience a bug, you can **optionally** share logs:
1. Go to **Settings > Help & Debugging**
2. Click **View Debug Logs**
3. Review the logs (sensitive data is automatically redacted)
4. Choose to copy, save to file, or create a GitHub issue

**You always control what gets shared. We never upload logs automatically.**

## GDPR Compliance (European Union Residents)

If you are a resident of the European Union:

### Legal Basis for Processing

| Processing Activity | Legal Basis |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Local data storage and AI processing | Legitimate interest (core app functionality) |
| Cloud AI processing (Claude API) | Explicit consent (you opt in by enabling Cloud AI) |
| Update checks (direct download builds only) | Legitimate interest (security and maintenance) |

### Your Rights

- **Right to access:** Your data is stored locally on your device. You have full access at all times.
- **Right to deletion:** Delete the application database to remove all stored data. Uninstall the app to remove all files.
- **Right to portability:** Your data is in a standard SQLite database that you can access, copy, or migrate at any time.
- **Right to withdraw consent:** Disable Cloud AI at any time in Settings to stop all data transmission to third parties.
- **Right to restriction:** You control which features are active. Disable Cloud AI to restrict processing to local-only.

### Data Transfers

When Cloud AI is enabled, your data is transmitted to Anthropic's servers, which may be located in the United States. This transfer is based on your explicit consent when enabling Cloud AI.

## Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)

If you are a Virginia resident, you have rights under the VCDPA. CommitLog's local-first architecture means:

- We do not **sell** your personal data
- We do not **process** your data for targeted advertising
- We do not **profile** you for decisions with legal or significant effects
- You have the right to **access, correct, delete, and obtain a copy** of your data — all of which you can do directly since your data is stored locally on your device

### Apple App Store Privacy Nutrition Label

- **Data Used to Track You:** None
- **Data Linked to You:** None

## 6. Intellectual Property

### Our Software

CommitLog, including its source code, user interface, design, algorithms, branding, and documentation, is the exclusive property of Benjamin Eccles. All rights reserved. This license grants you the right to **use** the Software, not to own it.

### Your Content

**You retain all rights, title, and interest** in and to your Input Content and Output Content. Benjamin Eccles claims **no ownership, license, or other rights** to any content you create, input, or generate using CommitLog.

CommitLog does not use your content to train or improve AI models. Local models are pre-trained and run entirely on your device. If you enable Cloud Services, your content is processed according to the third-party provider's terms (see Section 7).

---

## 7. Third-Party Cloud Services (Claude API)

CommitLog includes an **optional** integration with Anthropic's Claude API. This section applies only if you choose to enable it. The Software functions fully with local AI models and does not require Cloud Services.

### 7.1 Opt-In Nature

Cloud Services are disabled by default. You must actively configure and enable the Claude integration by providing your own Anthropic API key.

### 7.2 Your Responsibility

You are solely responsible for:
- Obtaining and paying for your own Anthropic API key and any associated costs
- Complying with Anthropic's [Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/terms) and [Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/usage-policy)
- Understanding Anthropic's pricing and usage limits

CommitLog does not broker, resell, or subsidize API access.

### 7.3 Data Transmission

When Cloud Services are enabled, the following data is transmitted to Anthropic's servers:
- Work log text and commit messages (for analysis)
- Analysis prompts (generated by the Software)

The following data is **never** transmitted:
- API keys, file paths, or local application settings
- Database contents beyond the specific text being analyzed
- User identity or device information

By enabling Cloud Services, you consent to this data transmission.

### 7.4 No Guarantee of Availability

CommitLog is not responsible for Anthropic API uptime, pricing changes, rate limits, deprecation of models, or changes to their terms of service. If Cloud Services become unavailable, the Software continues to function with local AI models.

### 7.5 Third-Party Data Handling

CommitLog's responsibility for your data ends at the point of transmission. Once your data reaches Anthropic's servers, it is governed by [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy). We are not liable for how Anthropic processes, stores, or handles your data.

---

## 8. Local and Cloud Processing

- **Local AI:** All processing occurs on your device. Your data never leaves your computer unless you enable Cloud Services.
- **Cloud AI (Optional):** When enabled, your work log text is sent to Anthropic's servers for analysis. See Section 7 for details.
- **Updates:** How you receive updates depends on how you obtained the Software:
  - **Mac App Store / Microsoft Store:** Updates are delivered through the respective store's built-in update mechanism. CommitLog does not make any update-related network calls in store builds — the operating system handles update checks, downloads, and installation according to the store's terms and your device settings.
  - **Direct download:** If you obtained CommitLog outside of an app store, the Software checks for updates on launch via a secure HTTPS connection to our update server, transmitting only your app version and platform (macOS/Windows). No user content is sent during update checks.

See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for complete details on data handling.

---

## 9. Third-Party Open Source Components

The Software includes third-party open source components, each subject to its own license terms. These include libraries such as Tauri, llama.cpp, Angular, and others. Their respective license texts are available within the Software under **Settings > Legal > Third-Party Licenses**.

Your use of these components is governed by their respective licenses. Nothing in this EULA restricts any rights you may have under those open source licenses with respect to the open source components alone.

---

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranties

CommitLog uses artificial intelligence to generate resume content. You acknowledge and agree that:

- AI-generated content (whether from local models or Cloud Services) is provided **as suggestions only**
- Generated content may contain errors, inaccuracies, omissions, or inappropriate suggestions
- You must **review and edit** all generated content before use
- We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of generated content for employment, professional, or any other purpose
- Output quality may vary between local and cloud models, across model versions, and based on input quality

- You are solely responsible for the accuracy and appropriateness of any content you use
